# Creating an Amazon Aurora RDS Database (MySQL Compatible)


- Description

In this hands-on lab, we will create an Aurora MySQL database. First, we will verify that the security groups, network ACL (NACL), 

and route tables are all configured to allow communication between an instance in a public subnet and an RDS database in a private subnet. 

After verifying the appropriate settings are in place, we will create the database. Once that is done, 

we will use an EC2 instance as a bastion to allow us to connect to our private database from an external source. 

We will utilize MySQL Workbench to connect to our private RDS Aurora database through the public EC2 bastion.



- Additional Information and Resources

Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided, and make sure you are in the us-east-1 region.

During the Aurora Database Creation steps, please ensure you have not selected "Easy Create" 

as this results in a default instance class selection of R5, which will result in an explicit deny.

Download and install MySQL Workbench on your desktop. This application is necessary to connect to the MySQL database. 

You can download the file directly from MySQL.
