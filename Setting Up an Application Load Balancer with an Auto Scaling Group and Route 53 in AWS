# Setting Up an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group and Route 53 in AWS


- Description

In this hands-on lab, we will set up an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling group and Route 53 to make our website highly available to all of our users.

First, we will create and configure an Application Load Balancer. Then, we'll create and configure Auto Scaling and review how it works in different scenarios. 

Finally, we will configure a Route 53 CNAME alias record that will be an alias for our Application Load Balancer to serve our website to all users.

# Create and Configure an Application Load Balancer


    Create and configure an Application Load Balancer.
    Choose name.
    Select only HTTP and select both Availability Zones.
    Choose existing security group.
    Choose name for target group.
    Under Advanced Settings: 3,2,5,10 to speed IP our timeouts. (Remember the ALS is looking for a 200 status code to pass the health checks.)
    Ignore all error messages.



- Create and Configure an Auto Scaling Group


    In the EC2 console, under Auto Scaling, select Launch Configurations.
    Choose AMI, and add a launch configuration name.
    Under Advanced Details, paste in the provided Bash script to configure our EC2 instance as a web server.
    Make sure to select Assign a public IP address to every instance.
    Choose the existing security group.
    Create a new key pair, and download it somewhere safe.
    Click Create Auto Scaling group.
    Add a name, make sure to choose the VPC with two subnets, change the health checks to 180 seconds, use scaling policies for 1 and 3, and choose CPU usage and set it to 80%.
    Now edit by selecting Actions.
    Add your target group and update your desired capacity to 2 and a minimum of 2, and click Save.
