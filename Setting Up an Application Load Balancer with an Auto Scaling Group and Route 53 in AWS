# Setting Up an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group and Route 53 in AWS


- Description

In this hands-on lab, we will set up an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling group and Route 53 to make our website highly available to all of our users.

First, we will create and configure an Application Load Balancer. Then, we'll create and configure Auto Scaling and review how it works in different scenarios. 

Finally, we will configure a Route 53 CNAME alias record that will be an alias for our Application Load Balancer to serve our website to all users.
