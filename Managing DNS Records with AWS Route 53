# Managing DNS Records with AWS Route 53



- Additional Information and Resources

Make sure that when you eventually navigate to the Route 53 hosted zone the only DNS records you see are the NS and SOA records - if there are others there you can delete them.

User Data code snippet for this lab:

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cp /usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html /var/www/html/index.html
service httpd start


- Create Two EC2 Instances


Inside of the AWS console, create two EC2 instances that you can later attach to an Elastic Load Balancer. Follow these steps for the creation process:

    Navigate to the EC2 portion of the console
    Press Launch Instances
    Pick an Amazon Linux AMI
    Select the T2 Micro free tier eligible instance type
    On the Configure Instance step make sure that the Linux Academy VPC is selected
    Make sure to select a different subnet for each of the two instances
    Make sure to change Auto-assign Public IP address to Enable
    Add a User Data Script under the advanced details section (see the description of this activity for the code you need)
    Press Next a few times until you get to the Confiure Security Group step
    Create two instances:
        Create a new security group and add HTTP access to the security group
        Make sure to select the security group you just created for the previous instance
    Press Next and press the button to launch the instance (you will have to create a keypair to do this step)
    Repeat these steps again, but make sure to note the differences between the first and second instance's creation process here


- Create an Elastic Load Balancer

Create an Elastic Load Balancer in the AWS console:

    Navigate to the Load Balander section of the EC2 console
    Press Create load balander
    Select Application load balancer
    Give the load balancer a name
    Make sure to include the two Availability zones for this load balancer
    Skip over the Configure Security Settings step
    On the Configure Security Groups step create a new security group with the defaults
    On the Configure Routing step make sure you select New target group and name your target group
    Under Advanced health check settings set Healthy Threshold to 2
    Wait a few minutes, then test out your new ELB from the DNS name provided under the ELB's description in the EC2 console


- Create Route 53 Record Sets

Create two aliased A Records inside the Route 53 hosted zone you are provided that point to the Elastic Load Balander domain:

    Navigate to the Route 53 portion of the console
    Enter the hosted zone for the custom domain you are provided
    Press the Create Record Set button and select the A - IPv4 Address type
    Make sure Alias is selected as Yes
    Find your Elastic Load Balancer domain in the dropdown, select that and then press Create down at the bottom of the page
    Repeat this process except make sure to enter www in the Name for one of the two records, so that you have an A record for the www subdomain too
