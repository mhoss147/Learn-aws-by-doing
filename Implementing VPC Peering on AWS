# Implementing VPC Peering on AWS



- Description

In this live environment you will learn how to create and configure VPC peering within AWS. 

VPC peering is a feature of AWS which allows cross-VPC communication without additional hardware or software solutions. 

VPC peering is a feature you will use daily in production environments, and it's useful to know for all of the AWS exams.

The environment is split into three stages. There is an architectural overview first, followed by the creation and configuration of a VPC peer, 

and finally the live environment will finish by demonstrating the limitations of VPC peering and some advanced features.

By the end of the learning activity you will be able to comfortably implement VPC peering, know it's limitations 

and perhaps more importantly understand when and why you would use the feature.
