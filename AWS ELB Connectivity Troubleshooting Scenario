# AWS ELB Connectivity Troubleshooting Scenario


- Description

Welcome to this hands-on AWS Learning Activity for troubleshooting EC2 connectivity issues.

The goal of this activity is to fix the broken environment and achieve the goal as outlined below. 

The first video in this activity presents the scenario and the goal, while the second video provides the solution (if needed). 

Do your best to solve the connectivity issue without viewing the solution video.

Goal: Fix the connectivity issue in the AWS environment so that you can view the Linux AMI/Apache test page of the provisioned EC2 instances via the ELB's DNS name.

Note/Hint: If your Instances don't show "In-Service" after a bit, try toggling the check type to http then back to tcp port 80.

Good luck!
